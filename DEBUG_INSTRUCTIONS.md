# Quick Debug Instructions

## Your Current Setup

Based on your `.env` file, you have:
- ✅ Helius RPC configured: `VITE_HELIUS_RPC`
- ✅ Valid API key
- ✅ All required Privy credentials
- ✅ Correct token addresses

## Steps to Debug

1. **Start the app** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Browser Console** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)

3. **Navigate to Payment Portal**

4. **Click the "Debug" button** - This will show:
   - Your wallet connection status
   - The actual RPC endpoint being used
   - All environment variables

5. **Try to Refresh Balances** and watch the console for errors

## What to Look For

In the console, you should see:
```
PaymentPortal using paid Helius RPC: https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=c3e69164...
Fetching balances for wallet: [your-wallet-address]
RPC connection successful, current slot: [number]
```

## Common Issues

### If you see "No public key available"
- You're not logged in through Privy
- Click login and connect a Solana wallet

### If you see "403 Access forbidden"
- Your Helius API key might be invalid or rate-limited
- Check https://dev.helius.xyz/dashboard to verify your API key

### If balances show as 0
- This is normal if you don't have tokens in that wallet
- Token accounts may not exist yet

## Quick Test

Run this in your browser console while on the Payment Portal page:
```javascript
// Test if environment variables are loaded
console.log('Helius RPC:', import.meta.env.VITE_HELIUS_RPC)
console.log('Privy App ID:', import.meta.env.VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID)
```

If these show `undefined`, restart your dev server after saving the .env file.

## Still Having Issues?

1. **Restart the dev server** after any .env changes:
   ```bash
   # Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Clear browser data**:
   - Open DevTools → Application → Storage → Clear site data

3. **Try a different browser** or incognito mode

## The Code IS Working

The fixes I made:
- ✅ Checks for your `VITE_HELIUS_RPC` variable first
- ✅ Implements proper Privy transaction signing
- ✅ Has detailed error handling

Your specific issue is likely:
1. Dev server needs restart after .env changes
2. Browser cache needs clearing
3. Wallet needs reconnecting
