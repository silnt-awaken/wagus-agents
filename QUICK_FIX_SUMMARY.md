# Your Balance Fetching Should Now Work!

## What I Fixed

1. **RPC Endpoint** - Now correctly uses your `VITE_HELIUS_RPC` variable
2. **Transaction Signing** - Implemented proper Privy wallet transaction signing
3. **Error Handling** - Better error messages to help debug issues

## To Test Right Now

1. **Restart your dev server** (IMPORTANT - .env changes need a restart):
   ```bash
   # Stop server with Ctrl+C, then:
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Go to Payment Portal** and you'll see:
   - A "Debug" button - click it to see your wallet/RPC status
   - A "Connection Test" widget in the bottom-right (dev mode only)

3. **Click "Run Tests"** in the Connection Test widget to verify:
   - ✅ Environment variables are loaded
   - ✅ RPC connection works
   - ✅ Wallet is connected
   - ✅ Balance fetching works

## Your Specific Setup

Your `.env` is correctly configured with:
- `VITE_HELIUS_RPC` = ✅ Valid Helius endpoint
- `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` = ✅ Set
- `VITE_WAGUS_MINT` = ✅ Correct token address

## If It's Still Not Working

The issue is likely one of these:

1. **Dev server wasn't restarted** after .env changes
2. **Browser cache** - Try incognito mode or clear site data
3. **Not logged in** - Make sure you connect through Privy first

## The Balance Fetching Process

1. You log in with Privy → Get wallet address
2. Click "Refresh Balances" → Connects to Helius RPC
3. Fetches SOL balance directly
4. Checks for WAGUS/USDC token accounts
5. Shows balances (0 if accounts don't exist)

Your Helius API key is valid and should work fine. Just make sure to restart the dev server!
