# Wallet Connection Debug Guide

## The Issue
You're getting "Invalid wallet address format" because the wallet address from Privy isn't being detected properly.

## What I've Added to Help Debug

### 1. Enhanced Wallet Detection
The code now looks for Solana wallets using multiple strategies:
- Checks for Privy embedded wallets
- Checks for wallets with "solana" in the type
- Checks for embedded wallet connectors
- Falls back to any connected wallet

### 2. Debug Console Logs
When you connect, check the browser console for:
```
Available wallets: [array of wallet objects]
Selected Solana wallet: {...}
Public key being used: [address]
Raw publicKey value: [what we're getting]
PublicKey type: [string/object/etc]
```

### 3. Manual Wallet Test Component
When not connected, you'll see a "Manual Wallet Test" section where you can:
1. Enter ANY Solana wallet address
2. Test if balance fetching works with that address
3. This helps isolate if the issue is with wallet connection or RPC

### 4. Connection Test Widget
In the bottom-right corner (dev mode), click "Run Tests" to check:
- Environment variables
- RPC connection
- Wallet status
- Balance fetching

## How to Debug Your Issue

1. **Restart Dev Server** (if you haven't already)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open Browser Console** (F12)

3. **Try to Connect Your Wallet**
   - Watch the console for wallet detection logs
   - Note what type of wallet is detected

4. **If Connection Fails**
   - Use the Manual Wallet Test with a known Solana address
   - This will tell you if RPC/balance fetching works

5. **Check the Debug Output**
   - Click "Debug" button in Payment Portal
   - Look for the wallet information printed

## Common Privy Wallet Issues

### Issue 1: Embedded Wallet Not Created
Privy embedded wallets need to be created first. Check if:
- You have a Solana wallet in your Privy account
- The wallet is properly initialized

### Issue 2: Wrong Wallet Type
Your Flutter app might use a different wallet setup than the React app:
- Flutter: Direct embedded wallet access
- React: Privy's wallet abstraction layer

### Issue 3: Address Format
The error suggests the address isn't a valid Solana address. Check:
- Is the address 44 characters long?
- Does it start with a valid Solana address character?
- Is it base58 encoded?

## Quick Test

In the browser console while on Payment Portal:
```javascript
// Check what wallets Privy sees
const { wallets } = await import('@privy-io/react-auth').then(m => m.useWallets())
console.log(wallets)

// Check current auth state  
const auth = window.__PRIVY_AUTH__ // If exposed
console.log(auth)
```

## If Manual Test Works But Privy Doesn't

This means:
- ✅ Your RPC is configured correctly
- ✅ Balance fetching logic works
- ❌ Privy isn't providing a valid wallet address

Solutions:
1. Check Privy dashboard for wallet configuration
2. Try disconnecting and reconnecting
3. Check if you need to create/import a Solana wallet in Privy first
4. Try using an external wallet (Phantom, Solflare) instead

## Next Steps

1. Tell me what you see in the console logs
2. Try the manual wallet test with your wallet address
3. Let me know if external wallets work vs embedded Privy wallet

The key is figuring out what format/type of wallet address Privy is providing vs what we expect.
